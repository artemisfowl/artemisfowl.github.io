title: Bare Minimum
---

This is a late post indeed. I am writing this post in the bare minimum setup which I had been trying to perfect.
There is indeed nothing that is perfect, but in my opinion, one can really settle down with certain things which
will just work out.

The one thing that this pandemic helped me with was sit down on this 7 year old system running Ubuntu 20.04 and
figure out the right configurations and the tools that I should be concentrating on in the near future. My choice
of tools have always been those which required more use of the keyboard and less use of the mouse. This has led
me to search for those programs which will allow me to survive in the terminal. Ofcourse there are those which
have now become so much embedded into the workflow that I will not be able to replace them, the web browser being
one of them. However, I am mostly referring to the tools that I use majority of the time, those can be something
that uses the least amount of system resources. So, here is the detailed thought process, listing of tools and
the configurations that I have as of now put into bare minimum.
