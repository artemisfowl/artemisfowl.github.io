title: Bare Minimum
---

This is a late post indeed. I am writing this post in the bare minimum setup which I had been trying to perfect.
There is indeed nothing that is perfect, but in my opinion, one can really settle down with certain things which
will just work out.

The one thing that this pandemic helped me with was sit down on this 7 year old system running Ubuntu 20.04 and
figure out the right configurations and the tools that I should be concentrating on in the near future.
